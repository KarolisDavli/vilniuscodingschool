          Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice.
          Azurill’s tail is large and bouncy. It is packed full of the nutrients
          this Pokémon needs to grow. Azurill can be seen bouncing and playing
          on its big, rubbery tail. Girafarig’s rear head contains a tiny brain
          that is too small for thinking. However, the rear head doesn’t need to
          sleep, so it can keep watch over its surroundings 24 hours a day.
